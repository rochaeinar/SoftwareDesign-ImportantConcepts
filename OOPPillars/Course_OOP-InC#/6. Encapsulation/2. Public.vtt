00:00.150 --> 00:05.190
OK before I jump into anything let me introduce you to a concept that you already have been using this

00:05.190 --> 00:07.320
whole time without knowing what it is.

00:07.380 --> 00:13.440
It is the concept of axis specifies axis specifies are basically tools at our disposal that allow us

00:13.440 --> 00:17.660
to show or hide methods properties constructors classes and fields.

00:17.660 --> 00:22.130
They're allowing us as programmers to specify access to the entire application.

00:22.140 --> 00:27.600
Now we have quite a few of them but I will be going over the very main ones which I use the most to

00:27.600 --> 00:28.560
keep the course simple.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.330
But once you understand the concept behind axis specifies which is not that complicated then you will

00:33.330 --> 00:37.420
be able to understand any other ones that might not have been mentioned in this course.

00:37.590 --> 00:42.630
Done this video will be going over public axis specified and you have guessed it right.

00:42.630 --> 00:49.080
Just like in the diagram that we saw in the previous video the public axis specifies says that if we

00:49.080 --> 00:56.790
make any method field property etc. public then it can be used from within the class and from the outside

00:56.790 --> 00:57.240
of the class.

00:57.270 --> 01:04.130
So in other words any object has access to it before even going over the other axis specifies.

01:04.140 --> 01:06.410
I want to propose a hypothetical problem.

01:06.600 --> 01:14.850
So again as we solve this hypothetical problem we can understand the concepts and what the idea is behind

01:14.850 --> 01:17.070
these concepts even more thoroughly.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.090
So imagine this.

01:18.240 --> 01:25.060
Imagine if one of our clients who were writing this application for says hey man we just got a new requirement.

01:25.230 --> 01:28.600
We want all of our sales people to have five stages of selling.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.750
As you can see here right.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.470
These stages are engaged the customer establish trust and address concerns demonstrate value and close

01:37.470 --> 01:38.300
the deal.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.040
These are some of the new ways in which they are trying to sell.

01:41.040 --> 01:41.560
Got it.

01:41.560 --> 01:47.070
Now the problem is that we want to only have the method sell to still be exposed to the world and not

01:47.130 --> 01:53.130
the five stages and we want to be able to override these five stages specifically in each of salesmen

01:53.130 --> 02:00.090
child classes or any other new salesman child class in the future that we might add please make it happen

02:00.090 --> 02:00.570
for us.

02:00.780 --> 02:01.500
Wow.

02:01.530 --> 02:02.490
So that's the problem.

02:02.910 --> 02:08.060
So let's take a look at the diagram that they sent us in order to better understand the requirements.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.330
As you can see we have our abstract salesmen class right here.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.570
Well they have that and we have the child classes I only have two here.

02:15.570 --> 02:21.150
But we obviously have more than two and what the requirement is is that we want to have only the sell

02:21.150 --> 02:22.630
method to be public.

02:22.680 --> 02:29.670
So this guy so that other objects can call it from the outside so they can call the sell method and

02:29.880 --> 02:35.020
it can show us how it sells but want to sell using five steps method.

02:35.250 --> 02:42.410
So these are other methods in which we are selling and this is what we want to use in order to sell.

02:42.480 --> 02:49.380
But what they say is that these methods cannot be accessed from outside of the class so they have to

02:49.380 --> 02:51.870
be only accessible from within the class.

02:52.050 --> 02:58.750
But then what they also say is that the five steps need to be overwrite a bull in the child classes.

02:58.860 --> 03:04.630
So they need to be a all into child classes but you know children have to have access to them.

03:04.740 --> 03:10.580
But the outside world can not have access to them right the outside world can only call cell.

03:10.680 --> 03:15.630
And the reasoning behind it is that you know the outside world if they only call let's say Step 3 address

03:15.630 --> 03:16.560
concerns.

03:16.560 --> 03:23.400
That's really not going to show how those salesman sells because that's only one part of the sale selling

03:23.400 --> 03:24.320
process right.

03:24.360 --> 03:31.350
If they call sell however sell within the class we'll know how to order the methods together it'll say

03:31.350 --> 03:35.730
first I engaged then I establish trust then I address concerns then I demonstrate value then I close.

03:35.730 --> 03:41.040
But anybody from the outside that does not know how to put these together and doesn't have that you

03:41.040 --> 03:45.870
know business logic behind them they might put them in the wrong order or they might just call one method

03:45.870 --> 03:48.680
or two methods and they will mess up the sell process right.

03:48.810 --> 03:53.750
So if you can imagine if this was actually a thing that was let's say this is some type of class that

03:53.790 --> 03:58.290
is actually making a sale then that sale would have been compromised.

03:58.320 --> 04:04.950
If you know somebody else just called the third method without knowing that they shouldn't just call

04:04.950 --> 04:05.750
the third method.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.630
Now what axis specifies give us once again it's just more stability and regulation.

04:10.710 --> 04:15.720
What we're doing is we're saying listen these methods we're going to hide from certain classes we're

04:15.720 --> 04:22.670
going to only show it to other classes because we know that what what can happen will happen right.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.670
So if we leave these public then we know that there's a chance somebody might call them and if they

04:26.670 --> 04:29.160
call them then that's not going to be the proper process.

04:29.160 --> 04:35.490
So why not mitigate that risk and hide them and only expose what we need to expose so that there is

04:35.490 --> 04:38.440
no risk of sabotaging a sale.

04:38.460 --> 04:38.760
Right.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.740
So that's kind of like the idea behind the requirement.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.290
So let's start from the simplest part.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.770
We have our sell method.

04:44.880 --> 04:50.190
We only have that let's go ahead and make sure that the world can access it once we check and verified

04:50.190 --> 04:52.090
that that part works.

04:52.170 --> 04:57.930
We'll then move on to making the five stages of selling and then making them override a bull only in

04:57.930 --> 04:59.100
the child classes.

04:59.100 --> 05:08.170
So I'll go ahead and open this one up and go to these salesmen abstract class and here we see that our

05:08.170 --> 05:12.820
sell is public seats these are the axis specifies so public public.

05:12.840 --> 05:18.130
So the property is also public construct there is also public where only this time we're talking about

05:18.130 --> 05:23.800
the method so we have public abstract abstract means that this can be overriding all in its child classes

05:23.800 --> 05:29.680
will you know that this is the return type not just void just see it says that it's not returning anything

05:29.680 --> 05:34.610
because it's not public is the axis specifies so that it says that the world can access it.

05:34.660 --> 05:40.210
Now once you once you inherit as a child from this abstract class as we saw in the previous videos for

05:40.210 --> 05:48.190
example on the retail salesperson then you can overwrite this cell class and that's fine that's actually

05:48.430 --> 05:52.240
make sure that this is you know we can access it.

05:52.570 --> 05:58.990
And so I'm going to actually go clean all this stuff up and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to

05:58.990 --> 06:06.910
say retail salesperson and that's equals new retail salesperson

06:20.340 --> 06:21.370
so here we go.

06:21.390 --> 06:26.270
And then I'm going to just say that sell.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.450
All right.

06:27.450 --> 06:27.900
Here we go.

06:28.110 --> 06:29.050
So we just verified it.

06:29.060 --> 06:29.880
This is public.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.180
So another class so a program.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.910
This is a class was able to use cell.

06:36.930 --> 06:41.640
So it was able to access cell from its own method which is Maine and the Maine is just kind of like

06:41.640 --> 06:43.370
the entry point into the whole application.

06:43.380 --> 06:44.580
But it is a method nevertheless.

06:44.610 --> 06:48.180
So you know it's able to access our cell method.

06:48.180 --> 06:55.830
So for now we know that we're using public access specified to expose cell method and it is able to

06:55.830 --> 06:59.740
be accessed from within and from the outside classes.

06:59.790 --> 07:02.370
That part of our requirement has been satisfied.

07:02.370 --> 07:06.300
And the next couple of videos will be satisfying the rest of the business requirements.
