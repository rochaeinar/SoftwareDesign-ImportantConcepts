00:00.120 --> 00:03.100
So it is time for us to start talking about encapsulation.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.610
Let's first define it.

00:04.950 --> 00:10.680
The simplest way to think of encapsulation is to think of it as a protective shield that prevents the

00:10.680 --> 00:14.540
data from being accessed by the code outside the shield.

00:14.550 --> 00:15.810
That's all.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.850
Here I have a very simple example to demonstrate what I mean.

00:18.930 --> 00:25.230
Let's say that our object which is right here is the circle and within the object we have a method called

00:25.230 --> 00:26.910
go to work this guy.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.040
And then we have separate steps which define how we get to work.

00:31.050 --> 00:34.410
So these guys right here these are each a separate method.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.140
You can think of.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.450
Now we see how I have public and private right.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.450
Private and public right here.

00:39.450 --> 00:46.350
Basically I'm saying here to go to work method is public and the rest of the methods which are the numbers

00:46.380 --> 00:47.420
are private.

00:47.460 --> 00:51.750
I'm also saying that the go to work method calls all of the numbered methods.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.890
So this guy calls all of these so that it knows how to get to work.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.980
So in other words objects outside of the circle.

01:01.980 --> 01:08.970
Anything outside of the circle can call our go to work method but they cannot call any of the private

01:08.970 --> 01:10.170
methods right here.

01:10.230 --> 01:14.840
The only method which can call the number and methods is the go to work method which is right here.

01:14.850 --> 01:19.230
So see some random objects says Where are you.

01:19.230 --> 01:23.370
It is 9 a.m. and we respond back by saying no problem.

01:23.370 --> 01:30.090
Just call my go to work method which is right here and I will get to work because anything outside of

01:30.090 --> 01:36.840
it can interact with our public method but they cannot interact with the private methods that some other

01:36.840 --> 01:38.200
objects as.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.660
How do you get to work and what we say is don't worry about it.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.030
And that's just us making these private.

01:45.030 --> 01:48.430
We don't want to expose our dysfunctionality.

01:48.510 --> 01:51.000
This is the essence of encapsulation.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.230
We decide what we want to expose out into the world and let the world be able to interact with and some

01:59.230 --> 02:04.840
of the things we keep it to ourselves such as these methods because we don't want the world to know

02:04.840 --> 02:08.970
about them for whatever reason that is going to be specific for each scenario.

02:09.010 --> 02:09.580
That's it.

02:09.610 --> 02:13.420
We'll be talking more about the technical details in our next videos.
