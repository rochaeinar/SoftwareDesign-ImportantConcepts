Now this video is going to be pretty short because the private access specified is very simple to understand.

00:05.450 --> 00:08.730
And that's exactly what we're going to talk about in this video.

00:08.730 --> 00:14.970
All that is saying is if something is set as private then it can only and only be used from within the

00:14.970 --> 00:15.470
class.

00:15.480 --> 00:21.510
And nowhere else even classes inheriting from the class with private fields would or from you know with

00:21.540 --> 00:26.540
any other private member will not give access to the children classes.

00:26.550 --> 00:34.860
And that is all in our case we have the fields as private and the property as you can see is public.

00:34.860 --> 00:41.220
So the fields can only be used from within our abstract class.

00:41.220 --> 00:42.700
And we've already seen that.

00:42.840 --> 00:50.010
No this reason why specifically we keep our fields private which is the reason why it's a best practice

00:50.010 --> 00:57.930
to do so is because fields are the building blocks of classes and we don't want to expose the building

00:57.930 --> 01:04.340
blocks to other classes since they can be messing around with the workings of our current class.

01:04.410 --> 01:08.610
We want to keep the building blocks private but that is just an example for fields.

01:08.610 --> 01:12.410
You can set other things private as well such as constructors.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.320
You can set your properties as private.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.250
You can set your methods as private so you know you can set.

01:22.260 --> 01:27.150
If you have an engage and that's you know a concrete class you can set that as private.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.950
So let's say sell.

01:28.970 --> 01:35.810
I'm just going to comment these out or just take these out real quickly in private.

01:35.820 --> 01:42.000
You can have a private method like that then it can only in only be used from within the salesman class.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.720
Right.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.030
And that's it that's all.

01:45.030 --> 01:52.050
A private access specify is you basically you know the bottom line is that you set things private which

01:52.050 --> 01:56.550
you don't want to be access by anything else other than your class.

01:56.610 --> 01:57.710
And that's about it.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.380
In the next section we will be talking about abstraction.
