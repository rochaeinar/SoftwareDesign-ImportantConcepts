WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:04.340
OK so let's go ahead and fulfill the requirements for promoters.

00:04.380 --> 00:06.520
Let's see what we can do.

00:06.540 --> 00:12.150
So in this case we're going to use the protected access specified to give access to the children but

00:12.150 --> 00:13.320
not to the outside world.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.470
I hope you've done that when you were doing it yourself.

00:16.110 --> 00:20.010
So I'm going to do is I'm going to create a method called shared with inner circle.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.140
So let's go back Cheryl our circle and then paid ads.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.770
So I'm going to say use paid ads.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.110
Right.

00:25.780 --> 00:36.600
So go back here go to promoter and the promoter will say I have protected abstract void and it's going

00:36.600 --> 00:43.280
to say share with inner circle.

00:44.460 --> 00:49.060
How it's going to do it is going to be defined on the inheriting class.

00:49.100 --> 00:59.850
So that's one and then the other is going to be used paid ads so use paid ads.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.550
And the other thing is that the promote is no longer going to be abstract.

01:05.610 --> 01:14.100
It's going to be concrete but we will define these abstract methods which basically defines how promote

01:14.100 --> 01:15.380
works essentially.

01:15.420 --> 01:20.650
So we say this dot share within our circle.

01:20.650 --> 01:28.950
So this is not abstract anymore I'll take that out and then the next one is this use paid ads.

01:28.950 --> 01:38.520
All right so let's do that and then let's go back to Armenia and this we can no longer override but

01:38.520 --> 01:41.180
we can't override as the methods within that.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.960
So these guys right here you know promote anymore.

01:47.140 --> 01:53.470
Take that out and implement abstract class or we go these are the guys I'm going to put them right up

01:53.470 --> 01:56.900
there just for readability purposes.

01:57.490 --> 02:00.810
OK so we have that there.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.630
So basically fulfill this requirement as well.

02:03.640 --> 02:09.660
Now let's actually start creating the constructors so we know that the writer has first name last name.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.020
So let's go out and do that.

02:11.050 --> 02:15.240
So a writer right here has a constructor.

02:15.250 --> 02:22.480
So we're going to say public writer and it's going to have first name and last name.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.470
So let's do Strang first name.

02:27.710 --> 02:38.120
So first name string last name and then we're going to have fields so a private String.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.120
I'm going to say first name here and private.

02:44.310 --> 02:45.510
OK.

02:47.390 --> 02:49.880
And last name right here.

02:51.400 --> 02:51.930
OK.

02:52.240 --> 02:58.890
So then we have to set these fields first name equals first name.

02:59.230 --> 03:08.210
And this last name last name equals notice keyboard is being a little strange today.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.650
Last name is last name.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.310
OK.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.290
So I think that does that.

03:14.290 --> 03:17.950
Now we need to set them in the chalk glasses you remember that.

03:17.950 --> 03:22.220
So we need to I'm actually going to take this out and regenerate it.

03:22.370 --> 03:25.010
So I'm going to let it regenerate the entire constructor.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.570
So this is good to go and do the same thing with this guy.

03:29.290 --> 03:32.290
Let it regenerate itself sent off to write code.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.090
Here we go.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.490
And that starts a book writer and blog writer.

03:36.490 --> 03:39.840
Let's see what we have missed so far.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.380
So here we go.

03:41.380 --> 03:47.770
I think the first name last name and this is taken care for the writer and then we have this author

03:47.770 --> 03:52.490
bio which is basically a property so I'm going to go out and create that as well.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.150
And this is just in the writer.

03:55.150 --> 04:02.020
So let's go ahead here and let's say public string.

04:02.440 --> 04:10.200
And I'm going to say author bio author bio.

04:10.510 --> 04:11.780
And here we go.

04:11.790 --> 04:20.080
Get and return.

04:21.220 --> 04:33.220
And I will say Strang the format so we can fill in the place folders and that's going to give me.

04:34.030 --> 04:41.030
So let's actually put in here and then I will say what it wants.

04:41.420 --> 04:42.820
Using system that's cool.

04:43.560 --> 04:51.190
And this that first name and this the last name.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.890
So essentially what I'm doing is I'm saying this is the quick property to kind of show our information

04:56.890 --> 04:57.750
and more readable way.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.990
That's all that this is and we're getting that information you know quote unquote from the database.

05:02.010 --> 05:08.220
So it's can say my name is whatever the first name and last name that are given in our constructor.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.920
So a writer seems to be good to go.

05:10.920 --> 05:16.260
The next thing is are promoters so the promoter has is pretty similar except that we have this extra

05:16.260 --> 05:17.670
field which is a cell phone.

05:18.210 --> 05:23.790
So we can actually go out and copy this guy and actually we're going to copy this whole thing and go

05:23.790 --> 05:34.560
to promoter and we're we're going to do is we're going to paste that here and we're going to say the

05:35.430 --> 05:39.950
name is different friend just to match it up to constructor name with a class time you only know that.

05:40.140 --> 05:52.830
And then I'm going to say in the phone and that order you know cell phone the words and the be private

05:54.510 --> 05:56.020
and phone.

05:56.100 --> 06:02.670
So cell phone and cell phone does good to go as well.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.430
Let me see.

06:04.470 --> 06:10.440
So then we're setting it here everything is good here and then we're going to have to set it in here.

06:10.620 --> 06:16.420
So cell phone equals cell phone OK not that.

06:17.580 --> 06:18.000
OK.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.440
So then I think we are looking good except that something's not fine here.

06:25.590 --> 06:26.340
Because I misspoke.

06:27.420 --> 06:27.720
OK.

06:27.750 --> 06:38.050
So cell phone cell phone so far on my business cards and next thing so is there my business card so

06:38.050 --> 06:38.650
the business cards.

06:38.670 --> 06:41.820
But basically you're gonna be the first name last name and the phone numbers.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.130
It's not that complicated.

06:43.190 --> 06:44.410
Going to grab this guy.

06:46.450 --> 06:55.050
Come back here and it's just says 0 1 2 so it's 3 properties as placeholders first name last name and

06:55.090 --> 06:57.460
the third one is the phone.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.480
A cell phone number.

06:59.770 --> 07:02.370
So we need to use console.

07:02.380 --> 07:08.440
Are you using system to be able to get access to the string and then it's methods that are approved

07:08.500 --> 07:08.950
for it.

07:09.400 --> 07:15.790
So just format and really took care of the promotion and the steps and the constructor is there.

07:15.790 --> 07:22.630
Now we have to go to its children classes and as you've seen in the previous writer based class we need

07:22.630 --> 07:25.930
to generate the constructor.

07:25.930 --> 07:30.850
So that's good to go and do the same thing with this guy.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.780
So here we go.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.050
And we're looking good.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.940
Let's go back once again look at our requirements.

07:39.460 --> 07:45.540
So we have our property we have our constructor property constructors are looking good.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.260
This is all looking good.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.250
This is all looking good.

07:49.450 --> 07:52.110
Now this entire thing is looking good.

07:52.150 --> 07:55.850
The only thing we need to do is left to do is create the lists.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.430
So let's go ahead and do that.

07:57.430 --> 07:59.070
We're going to start from the list one.

07:59.140 --> 08:03.560
And it says databases three writers and three promoters I mean doesn't really matter.

08:03.640 --> 08:09.340
We what we care about is the list so we can be very creative with with the text and we you know we're

08:09.340 --> 08:10.330
going to do that afterwards.

08:10.330 --> 08:15.040
But let's actually go ahead and create the list and then and then we'll create the text after that.

08:15.040 --> 08:26.860
So I'm going to go back and I'm going to say Close these guys just once again clean our dashboard say

08:26.860 --> 08:27.570
that.

08:27.910 --> 08:37.090
And in the program what I'm going to say is I'm going to say we have a list of so it's going to be promoters

08:38.800 --> 08:47.210
and let's see motors promoters equals new list of promoters.

08:47.890 --> 08:52.390
And here we go.

08:52.390 --> 08:58.060
We're going to need to import systems collection generic to be able to use the lists go back once again

08:58.660 --> 09:00.480
show to access and one Omni.

09:00.510 --> 09:01.180
Right.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.480
So let's do that.

09:02.680 --> 09:11.130
So new promoter or rather Net Promoter IP address access club promoter.

09:11.470 --> 09:16.280
So what we need and this takes in First Name Last Name is cell phones.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.780
So first name I'm going to say John Jones

09:22.210 --> 09:36.100
and I'm gonna say 6 1 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 and then let's see oh it's because our number is way larger than

09:36.520 --> 09:38.140
an integer can hold.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.890
So we're actually going to do is we're gonna go and fix that real quick.

09:41.890 --> 09:45.820
We can go to the promoter and change this too long.

09:46.210 --> 09:52.900
That'll give us enough space and capacity to store a large number like that we can also store that as

09:52.900 --> 09:53.310
a string.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.420
That's also not our problem.

09:54.430 --> 09:57.280
But yeah I'm destroying it as numbers so it doesn't really matter.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.890
You could have done it as a string you know won't make much of a difference.

10:01.960 --> 10:10.130
So you see so in this case I'm not really sure what's working.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.300
Let's go and try to troubleshoot this real quick.

10:13.500 --> 10:21.030
So we have this and this is already a long time long.

10:21.030 --> 10:27.270
So we have that there and our promoter is access club promoter.

10:27.650 --> 10:34.610
Really sure if it's not taking this then it's actually go to excess club promoter.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.900
That's the thing.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.720
I would go it's all about the details.

10:38.780 --> 10:44.860
Got to follow the trail and you eventually will find the bucks and now excess club promoter and Armenia

10:44.950 --> 10:49.110
club promoter both you have to fix that's one problem out the way.

10:50.190 --> 11:01.490
And so to excess I'm going to say John Jones Jones and another like Jim Jones and this one is 6 1 8

11:02.790 --> 11:05.900
and then we're going to have another one called.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.690
This one is gonna be Armenia.

11:08.850 --> 11:11.310
So it's gonna be Armenia.

11:11.310 --> 11:20.040
A promoter analysts make this Jane Jones OK.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.930
And this is gonna be new.

11:21.930 --> 11:27.630
You have to use their reserve you're new to instantiate the class and get an object out of it and 6

11:27.630 --> 11:31.320
1 9 5 5 5 5 5 5.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.590
Okay.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.670
One two three four one two three.

11:35.670 --> 11:36.100
Cool.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.180
OK.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.630
We've got our first list down.

11:38.970 --> 11:39.890
Let's.

11:40.140 --> 11:42.320
So it's actually copy that.

11:43.580 --> 11:48.470
And we're gonna keep the names the same because it's not really about that.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.900
It's about us getting the requirements down.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.010
That's really the important part here.

11:53.150 --> 11:57.190
And list two we have three writers two book writers and one blog writer.

11:57.440 --> 12:08.320
So to book writers first of all make this in to writers and to book and one blog to book and one blog.

12:08.930 --> 12:10.830
So writers.

12:12.080 --> 12:18.790
So this is gonna be a book writer book writer and a blog writer.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.940
Cool.

12:19.940 --> 12:27.220
Get these name get the rather the phones out because we don't have that parameter in our book.

12:27.230 --> 12:32.240
Writer and blog writer because we don't have it in our writer base class.

12:32.420 --> 12:40.030
And this should do that then we have a list three which is going to have two body builders of any type.

12:40.030 --> 12:42.340
That has to be excess club promoter.

12:42.370 --> 12:54.970
Now let's go back here and we're going to say this list holds I body builders and I'm going to say body

12:54.970 --> 12:58.240
builders body.

13:00.310 --> 13:06.080
And this is going to be messy.

13:07.450 --> 13:14.010
This is going to be excess promoter or someone's again John and then another one.

13:14.010 --> 13:17.120
Jim you know they know those guys.

13:17.560 --> 13:22.810
So the reason why it's underlined by the way is because we haven't put the cell phone numbers in so

13:22.810 --> 13:28.890
we're going to add those up here we go as a as you can see they're accepted in the eye.

13:28.900 --> 13:36.650
Body bodybuilder types and then we're going to copy and paste that and let's see this war is going to

13:36.650 --> 13:43.280
have to loggers any time so I'm going to choose to loggers I'm going to choose one blog writer or another

13:43.280 --> 13:43.950
one.

13:44.570 --> 13:48.710
Excess club promoter just so that you can see how it combines unrelated groups.

13:48.830 --> 13:51.470
And so let's do exactly that.

13:51.500 --> 14:00.850
I'm going to go back here and I'm going to save loggers.

14:02.010 --> 14:08.330
I'm going to say I blogger

14:11.230 --> 14:14.390
blogger one is access club promoter.

14:14.390 --> 14:18.280
Another one is going to be new.

14:19.070 --> 14:25.540
Let's grab this guy so grab Jim bring him down here.

14:25.640 --> 14:26.870
He's also a blogger.

14:26.870 --> 14:28.670
See they fit into the same list.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.060
So we also have the list ready.

14:31.190 --> 14:34.010
So then we want to see how promoters promote how art is right.

14:34.010 --> 14:36.080
How bodybuilders work out of bloggers blog.

14:36.230 --> 14:37.760
And we can be created with a text.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.680
So here's what I'm gonna do.

14:38.690 --> 14:44.300
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna I'm gonna write a for each loop for each of these guys and I'm going to save

14:44.300 --> 14:46.660
for each.

14:48.050 --> 14:55.030
So var promoter and promoters rights.

14:56.850 --> 15:04.040
And I'm gonna say promoter that promotes.

15:05.120 --> 15:16.320
And I'm going to use the same thing for writers and this is going to just say writer and writer is going

15:16.320 --> 15:19.160
to write.

15:19.190 --> 15:21.020
Here we go.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.780
Same thing for bodybuilders and loggers

15:35.110 --> 15:37.240
and rock gods.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.090
And then I'm gonna put the last one down here.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.430
So it's a logger of log

15:49.300 --> 15:52.260
that's a log.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.670
So here we go.

15:53.690 --> 15:59.390
Now all we need to do is go and fill in all of the messages that we want it to show.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.800
And then we should be good to go.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.850
So let's go one by one.

16:01.850 --> 16:05.930
So the blogger says I log cool.

16:06.170 --> 16:07.750
Let's see what it should say.

16:07.760 --> 16:15.850
So I say console right line and then we're going to have to import those guys you already know.

16:15.860 --> 16:25.630
And I'm going to say I've log using my GoPro so what I'm going to say.

16:25.730 --> 16:29.320
So that's what a blogger does.

16:29.600 --> 16:39.140
And then I'm going to say I write so this one is for the blogger.

16:39.530 --> 16:45.420
I write in my blog I write and I write for my own blog.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.970
OK very simple just kind of making sure it works.

16:50.980 --> 16:52.960
Book This also has a blog.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.550
So I'm going to say I blog using my iPhone.

16:57.570 --> 16:59.290
All right.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.700
So different implementation of the same method.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.770
So this is polymorphism right here guys.

17:03.770 --> 17:06.470
So let's see.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.340
So so we need to use system.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.740
Cool.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.660
Let's see if I put a period on the other one.

17:13.730 --> 17:14.860
Yes I did.

17:14.870 --> 17:16.330
Just to keep it consistent.

17:16.640 --> 17:23.210
I write I write books.

17:23.210 --> 17:23.660
All right.

17:23.660 --> 17:26.920
Once again just keeping it simple keeping it simple.

17:26.990 --> 17:34.450
I bodybuilder doesn't do nothing as an empty interface blogger empty interface omni club promoter use.

17:34.510 --> 17:36.140
You use paid ads.

17:36.140 --> 17:47.040
So I'm going to say I use Google AdWords for paid ads rants.

17:47.090 --> 17:58.880
Then as that guy takes care of that and then share with the inner circle I'm going to say I share with

17:58.880 --> 18:01.060
my friends.

18:01.320 --> 18:01.820
OK.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.120
And that's that for the Armenia program.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.270
This is what really had.

18:08.430 --> 18:10.160
This doesn't really need much on it.

18:10.160 --> 18:14.900
And then the writer doesn't really need much on it as well.

18:14.930 --> 18:16.190
And then the excess club promoter.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.280
So this is the guy here.

18:18.330 --> 18:18.950
Let's see.

18:19.010 --> 18:30.930
I will say for use paydays I would say I use Facebook ads.

18:31.580 --> 18:32.680
OK.

18:32.990 --> 18:34.010
So that's that.

18:34.100 --> 18:45.770
And then I will say for share with inner circle I will say I share with my Instagram followers.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.350
All right.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.320
Share with my instagram followers capitalize that for the hell of it.

18:52.460 --> 18:57.090
And then I am here.

18:57.150 --> 19:03.810
The vlog I will say I use a professional.

19:04.670 --> 19:15.560
Oh I will say I use DSA LA to in order to log and I will say

19:21.920 --> 19:23.360
I work out

19:26.060 --> 19:28.210
at my house.

19:30.050 --> 19:30.660
So here we go.

19:30.660 --> 19:34.730
Now we have everything filled out and in the next video we'll be running it.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.530
And just kind of going over the structure and just talking about what we've done so far.
