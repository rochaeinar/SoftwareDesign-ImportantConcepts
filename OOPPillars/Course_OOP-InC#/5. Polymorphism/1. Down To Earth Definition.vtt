00:00.120 --> 00:05.370
Now it is time for us to define the second feature of object or in a programming which is polymorphism.

00:05.370 --> 00:09.630
I would define it in a very high level manner and in the next two videos we will talk more about the

00:09.630 --> 00:10.470
specifics.

00:10.470 --> 00:15.680
So with that said polymorphism simply stays that you can have the same form with different behavior.

00:15.690 --> 00:18.060
That is all nothing more nothing less.

00:18.090 --> 00:23.450
So you can have two components which have the same form but behave differently.

00:23.450 --> 00:28.500
Now there are two types of polymorphism one called static and another one called dynamic polymorphism

00:28.680 --> 00:34.830
and static polymorphism two components that can be the same but have different behaviour are methods

00:34.980 --> 00:41.070
so static polymorphism is on a method level meaning that we can do it within our concrete classes right

00:41.070 --> 00:45.240
here we can do it in our abstract classes right here.

00:45.330 --> 00:50.850
We can even do it in our interface but dynamic polymorphism is on a class level meaning that we need

00:50.850 --> 00:58.970
our abstract classes or abstract class or our interface in order to perform dynamic polymorphism in

00:58.990 --> 01:04.810
the next two videos we will explore more and see how we perform both static and dynamic polymorphism.
