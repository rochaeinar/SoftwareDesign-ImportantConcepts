00:00.300 --> 00:07.950
So first we're going to download and install dot net core as decay dot net core is basically an open

00:07.950 --> 00:12.500
source framework for Windows Linux and Mac OS operating systems.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.980
Now what is a framework you might ask.

00:15.210 --> 00:21.480
To put it very simply it is just a collection of libraries a.k.a. a code that other people at Microsoft

00:21.480 --> 00:22.640
have already written.

00:22.650 --> 00:29.100
So we can use right out of the box it is pre written functionality that we can use for free without

00:29.100 --> 00:32.010
having to write anything ourselves.

00:32.010 --> 00:35.980
Just makes development easier so we don't have to reinvent the wheel.

00:36.030 --> 00:39.450
That's all a framework is nothing more nothing less.

00:39.450 --> 00:45.120
One special thing about that night core though is that it is a new framework by Microsoft and it is

00:45.120 --> 00:51.180
cross platform compatible so if you want to use it on Windows Linux or Mac OS operating systems you

00:51.180 --> 00:57.380
can our reason for using it is because it is new so want to stay with the latest and greatest.

00:57.390 --> 01:03.450
Now you might also ask what's the difference between dot net core and dot net core as decay.

01:03.450 --> 01:04.960
And that's a good question.

01:05.040 --> 01:12.900
Basically dot net core is just the framework but dot net core SDK is a package of dot net core plus

01:13.410 --> 01:19.070
other tools that will allow us to build applications using dot net core.

01:19.080 --> 01:25.400
So once again it is dot net core plus other stuff that we need in order to write apps.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.860
That's all you will see some of those tools in the next video.

01:28.860 --> 01:33.000
For now let's go ahead and download and install dot net core as decay.

01:33.300 --> 01:42.870
So as you see I'm on Google just type in download dot net core as decay say Google search and then the

01:42.870 --> 01:52.870
first link as you see right here click on that and then you will choose build apps so click download

01:52.870 --> 01:54.400
dot net core as Dick

01:57.650 --> 01:58.820
wait for it to download

02:04.560 --> 02:07.350
so once as download it just open it up

02:10.370 --> 02:17.780
give it a few seconds and now the installation process is actually very simple just say install

02:24.320 --> 02:25.370
and let it do its thing

02:31.730 --> 02:40.490
great installation was successful you can close and I would suggest you restart your computer before

02:40.490 --> 02:44.900
moving onto the next video so that everything is proper.

02:44.900 --> 02:45.850
I'll see you in the next video.
