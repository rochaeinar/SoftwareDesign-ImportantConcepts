Before we even start talking about object oriented programming let's step back a bit and define what

00:06.000 --> 00:07.530
a program is.

00:07.530 --> 00:13.890
The reason is because we will see the entire evolution of how programs were written and how object oriented

00:13.890 --> 00:20.430
programming came to the scene and most importantly why this will make you more well-rounded as a software

00:20.430 --> 00:21.060
developer.

00:21.060 --> 00:22.330
So what is a program.

00:22.350 --> 00:28.140
So as you can see in this diagram program is our intention and it is written in a programming language

00:28.560 --> 00:35.210
which gets translated to machine language to let the computer know what to do.

00:35.220 --> 00:41.550
So in this nifty diagram you can see it all starts with an idea either something want to build or a

00:41.550 --> 00:43.170
problem one to solve.

00:43.170 --> 00:49.170
We start from an idea hey we have to do this down we have to do that after we have to do some other

00:49.170 --> 00:49.610
stuff.

00:49.680 --> 00:57.090
Whatever it is then we have to convert our idea and our intention of getting that idea working into

00:57.090 --> 00:59.460
code using a programming language.

00:59.460 --> 01:03.750
So here is some simple pseudo code showing functions called Do this do that.

01:03.750 --> 01:04.900
Do some other stuff.

01:04.920 --> 01:11.220
So this code written in some programming language gets converted to machine language that a computer

01:11.310 --> 01:18.390
can understand and then our program runs a.k.a. our intention which basically makes our idea come to

01:18.390 --> 01:19.050
life.

01:19.050 --> 01:25.290
So starts from an intention we write that intention into code using a programming language gets converted

01:25.290 --> 01:28.470
to machine language which then a computer can understand.

01:28.590 --> 01:32.960
So this is the basic lifecycle of a program from beginning to end.
